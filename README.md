In movies, especially movies directed by Wong Kar Wai, you can find many quotes to resonate with. Here's one from *==Chungking Express 1994==* that I really like.
> If memories could be canned, would they also have expiry dates? If so, I hope they last for centuries.
*In movies, you can see your reality and in your reality, you can recognize movies.*
Movies...I really like movies.
